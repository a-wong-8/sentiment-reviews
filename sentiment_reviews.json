If every clinic/health community can achieve that level, that is great. I believe it will take more training for the healthcare professionals to effectively practice ACE assessments because it is almost like being a psychologist/counselor themselves when that is not their professional study. Empathy is not a natural character or skill for all, so that takes time and work to develop. I enjoyed that specialty case where they acknowledged the burnout that professional staff face. It is always a great motto to take care of your own staff.

Initiatives like ACEs can actually be harmful because they point out the ways that trauma of these communities can be harmful without discussing the actual root causes of trauma. They also do not discuss how trauma, understood as an ongoing response to an isolated incident or continued experience of violence, serves to protect people or act as an important mode of resistance. This negligence of systemic violence may be politically expedient to the makers of the program, or perhaps is a result of ignorance of these issues, both of which need to finally be addressed in the health care system. These problems cannot continue to be framed only in terms of how they affect a person's ability to optimally function in a system that actively deprioritizes their health and well-being, oppresses and criminalizes them. We need more frank and open discussions about the systems that lead to the discussed issues, we need resource investment - including substantial time and money - by the health care community in working to combat these systems, rather than spending all of our time and effort studying poor folks and creating approaches that continue to fail to recognize and act against the systemic violence enacted upon them.
